This is my third project from the Job week (PRAO). This third project improved my Python skills very well because - so more stuff you do so more you understand. Yeah, so basically while I made this Flappy Bird game I had some memories from my other projects so it was pretty easy to understand the source/code. 


## Source


I didnt make this flappy bird by myself, because personally I just cant do it because Im not skilled yet in computer science languages. I watched a great YouTube tutorial.

Here is the link on the tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiUGVOqqCKg

The project requires pygame. Type in these programs in terminal.
